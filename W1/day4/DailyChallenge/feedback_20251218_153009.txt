suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain the logic in more detail, especially for the second challenge (even though it was aided by an external tool, understanding and explaining the logic is important).
- The variable name 'lenght' has a typo; correct it to 'length'.
- For the second challenge, explore alternative solutions to broaden your understanding and improve your problem-solving skills.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both challenges as described in the prompt. Challenge 1 correctly calculates and outputs a list of multiples, and challenge 2 correctly removes consecutive duplicate letters from a given string, matching the examples and instructions provided in the prompt.
- readability: The code is generally readable, with clear variable names and comments. However, adding a few more comments, especially to explain the logic within the loops and conditional statements, would enhance readability.
- performance: The performance is efficient for the given tasks. The loops iterate the necessary number of times, and the string manipulation is straightforward. No significant performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code uses the `input()` function, which can be vulnerable to code injection if not handled carefully. However, in this specific case, where the input is used for numerical calculations and string manipulation, the risk is minimal. Nevertheless, validating the input or using safer input methods could further improve security.
