suggestions for improvement:
- The code is well-structured and addresses the requirements of both challenges effectively.
- Consider adding more comments to explain the logic behind certain operations, especially in the second challenge (e.g., why the dictionary order is important).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements the requirements of Challenge 1 (Letter Index Dictionary) by creating a dictionary that stores the indices of each letter in a word. The code also accurately implements the requirements of Challenge 2 (Affordable Items) by filtering and sorting the items that can be purchased within a budget. This aligns perfectly with the chapter content.
- readability: The code is generally readable due to clear variable names and comments. However, more comments could be added to further clarify complex logic.
- performance: The code has good performance for the given problem sizes. The use of `enumerate` is efficient for iterating through the word in Challenge 1. The dictionary iteration in Challenge 2 is also efficient.
- security: The code includes basic input validation in Challenge 1 to prevent non-letter characters. However, it's safe against common vulnerabilities for this type of challenge.
