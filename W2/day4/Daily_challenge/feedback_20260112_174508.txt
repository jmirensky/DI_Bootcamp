suggestions for improvement:
- The first challenge could use list comprehension for a more concise solution, as suggested in the original problem (though not explicitly required in the revised version).
- Consider adding more robust input validation to handle edge cases such as empty input or inputs with unexpected characters. It could prevent errors and improve the program's robustness.
Brief justification:
- correctness: Both challenges are correctly implemented, adhering to the instructions and producing the expected outputs as specified in the Chapter Content/Questions. The sorting challenge sorts comma-separated words, and the longest word challenge identifies the longest word in a sentence.
- readability: The code is well-structured and uses meaningful variable names, enhancing readability. The comments also help in understanding the code's logic.
- performance: The code uses efficient methods for string manipulation and sorting, resulting in good performance for the given tasks. Splitting strings and sorting lists are generally optimized operations in Python.
- security: The code does not involve any external data sources or complex operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities. Input sanitization is not explicitly required but could be considered for production environments.
