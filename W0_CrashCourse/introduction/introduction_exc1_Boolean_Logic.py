#Exercise 1 : Boolean Logic

#1. Declare a variable called first and assign it to the value "Hello World".
first = 'Hello World'

#2. Write a comment that says "This is a comment."
#   #This is a comment.

#3. Log a message to the terminal that says "I AM A COMPUTER!"

'''Write an if statement that checks if 1 is less than 2 and if 4 is greater than 2.
 If it is, show the message "Math is fun."'''
if 1 < 2 and 4 > 2:
    print('Math is fun')

#5. Assign a variable called nope to an absence of value.
nope = None

#6. Use the language’s “and” boolean operator to combine the language’s “true” value with its “false” value.
bool = bool(1) and bool (0)
print (bool)

#7. Calculate the length of the string "What's my length?"
lenght = len("What's my length?")
print(f'Lenght of the string is {lenght}')

#8. Convert the string "i am shouting" to uppercase.
print("i am shouting".upper())

#9. Convert the string "1000" to the number 1000.
number = int('1000')

#10. Combine the number 4 with the string "real" to produce "4real".
print (str(4) + "real") 

#11. Record the output of the expression 3 * "cool".
result = 3*"cool"
print(result)

#12. Record the output of the expression 1 / 0.  [I did it with Chat GPT]
try:
    result2 = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:      
    result2 = "Error: division by zero"
print(result2)

#13. Determine the type of []
print(type([]))

#14. Ask the user for their name, and store it in a variable called name.
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Welcome,{name.capitalize()}.")

#15. Ask the user for a number. 
    # If the number is negative, show a message that says "That number is less than 0!"
    # If the number is positive, show a message that says "That number is greater than 0!"
    # Otherwise, show a message that says "You picked 0!.
insert_numer = int(input("Please, write a number. "))
if insert_numer < 0:
    print("That number is less than 0!")
elif insert_numer > 0:
    print ("That number is greater than 0!")
else:
    print ("You picked 0!")

#16. Find the index of "l" in "apple".
print("apple".find("l"))  #forma1
print("apple".index("l")) #forma2

#17. Check whether "y" is in "xylophone".
result = "y" in "xylophone"
print(result)

#18. Check whether a string called my_string is all in lowercase.
my_string = "hello world"
result = my_string.islower()
print(result)
